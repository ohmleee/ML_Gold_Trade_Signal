# Machine Learning for Gold trading signal prediction
This project is a part of the "Introduction to Business Analytics and Data Science" course and aims to explore the application of machine learning techniques in predicting gold trading signals.

We utilized daily price data for gold from Yahoo Finance.
We framed the prediction problem as a classification task, where historical data was labeled using a look-ahead bias technique.

Our primary goal in developing this model was to showcase how data science knowledge can be applied to real-world scenarios. While this model may not be used for actual trading decisions, it serves as a valuable example of applying machine learning to financial data.
